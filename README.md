# OpenClaw OSINT

MIT-licensed standalone OpenClaw plugin for bounded public-source OSINT helpers.

This plugin is intentionally conservative. It provides useful public-source primitives without credentialed scraping, private data broker access, exploit checks, port scans, or shell execution.

## Tools

### `osint_extract_indicators`

Extracts indicators from supplied text without network access.

Returns:

- URLs
- domains
- IPv4 addresses
- email addresses present in the input
- social handles present in the input
- common cryptographic hashes

### `osint_url_snapshot`

Fetches one public HTTP(S) URL through OpenClaw's SSRF guard and returns bounded metadata:

- HTTP status and final URL
- content type
- page title
- description
- canonical URL
- bounded body excerpt wrapped as untrusted external content

## Install

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm pack
openclaw plugins install ./openclaw-osint-0.1.0.tgz
```

Restart the OpenClaw gateway after install.

## Build And Test

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

## Versioning

Use `v<major>.<feature>.<patch>` git tags. Keep the tag, `package.json` version, and `openclaw.plugin.json` version aligned.
